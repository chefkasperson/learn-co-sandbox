NDS to Insight Strategy
Understand the NDS
"Pretty-Print" NDS with pp
Home-Grown Pretty-Print NDS
Use [] to verify your understanding from Step 1
Print values to verify your understanding
Leave code comments and documentation for yourself
Wrap uses of [] from Step 2 into new methods
Create simple methods with meaningful names ("First-Order Methods")
Ensure "First-Order Methods" use arguments to create flexibility
See-saw between bottom-up and top-down method writing
Write a method that provides an insight e.g. oldest_student
Evaluate your First Order Methods
Can you use your First-Order Methods to build the insight method's implementation?
YES: Great! Your method is done!
NO: Build a new method that combines other methods to get closer to what the insight method needs. Repeat step 4
Insight method provides an insight! We're done!
We'll explain all these terms in the strategy in the coming lessons.

Learning Strategy: Read over the strategy and see if you can formulate questions you expect us to answer example. Cognitive research suggests that you learn more when you have an overview that you don't fully understand that you expect us to fill in!

We recommend printing this list out and keep it handy as you complete labs that require you to transform NDS' into insights.
